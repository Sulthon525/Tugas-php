  <h2>Self Introduction</h2>
  <p>I will introduce myself, my name is MUHAMMAD SULTHON, usually my friends call me by my last name, namely Sulthon or Ton, this name used to be a gift from my grandmother which means Muhammad is the name of the prophet, and Sulthon which means king. I am the second child of two siblings, I was born on June 6 2003, in the city of Tegal, Kauman village, West Tegal sub-district, my educational history started from a kindergarten called Al-Irsyad Kindergarten which is close to home, there was an incident. I always remember is that I was hit by a motorcycle while crossing the road from the kindergarten to the road to the house. At that time i was helped across by the security guard from the kindergarten. I was hit by a motorbike and fell, thankfully I didn't suffer serious injuries. When I was studying in elementary school, I went to Alirsyad too, it happened that the school was still close to my house. At my elementary school, I was a lazy child, I was lazy to do homework, lazy to make friends, lazy to study, but during the 6th grade national exam I was very excited studying for the national exam, I studied at school from 07.00 to 17.00 it was a tiring process, I am grateful that I was able to surpass my friends, I got 6th place out of all the students which totaled around 70 students from my batch, my mother at the time the announcement was very happy because I never got a ranking and was always in the last place. When I was in junior high school, I attended junior high school 10 Tegal, why did I study there because I wanted to help the economy by going to public schools, and I was also bored with the Al-Irsyad school system, which is full day school, or school from morning to evening. In junior high school I didn't get much achievement, because I was lazy to seek knowledge from various sources, as a result I became an ordinary student, I'm grateful to be able to pass with an average national exam of 28, then I finished high school at SMA N 2 Tegal because by zoning according to where I live, various stories have happened ranging from friendship, romance, achievements, and so on. In the past, when I wanted to register, I first registered for senior high school at SMA N 4. At that time, I was accompanied by my uncle. I left the house at 06.30 and came to school at 06.50. I was given a piece of paper containing a registration form, I was walking through the classroom and then to the field and then into the informatics room, where I filled in the origin of the school from 10 Tegal junior high school, then filled in questions containing material on natural science, mathematics, knowledge social studies, and English then I was filling in which schools I would go to there, first I chose Tegal 4 senior high school, then the second choice of 1 senior high school, and the final choice of Tegal 2 high school, on the first day I immediately bounced off the list of students attending SMA Negeri 4 Tegal, and I immediately checked the options my second, namely in high school 1 and my name was not there, and I finally came to Tegal 2 high school, and my name was there, and finally I waited until the 4th day after the opening of high school registration , and it was announced that I was attending Tegal 2 senior high school. On the first day of entering Tegal 2 public high school I left home at 06.30 and arrived at 06.45 quite quickly because it was not far from my house, first I parked my motorcycle in the parking lot, then I entered still wearing uniform Middle school student council, I got together with 300 other students who registered, the first time I got together I had no friends except acquaintances from the old school when I was in elementary school and junior high school, at first it was held like a ceremony, all students lined up perfectly, and the principal said thanks and congratulations to all students who have registered and attend Tegal 2 high school, then a speech from the head of the student council, then the students are called according to their names and classes so that they enter their respective classes, I am called and I am selected in the class Mipa 3, thank God I have an acquaintance from my school in that class first middle school, and I sat with a person named Octaru Mulia Hakim, he was a very cool person, he came from junior high school 7 which was on the way of Captain Sudibyo, this Octaru has the physical characteristics of being quite tall, his body is rather fat, his skin is white, his brows were thick, and his walk was a little slow. First when entering the class the greeting from the student council members and we discussed who would be class president, class homeroom, treasurer, secretary, who became class leader, namely my first acquaintance, Octaru Mulia Hakim, then deputy Mackenzie, treasurer Nabila, secretary Dwi, in that class we are given information from the student council members about what will be done during MPLS activities for 3 days after class selection, on the first day class selection is carried out and introductions to each student in the class, on the second day we do a guessing game who can't answered that they were given a sentence to sing in front of the class and in the next class, and were asked to find signatures from each student council member, on the third day all the students did the PBB which was led by the military, we did the PBB which was done for 2 hours, thankfully I was strong until the PBB event took place, but many students are not strong especially female students, after the pseudo PBB a student sent home. Enter on the first day which is filled in by the homeroom teacher, the first homeroom teacher in my class is Mrs. Amber, she teaches Citizenship Education subjects, she is about

  <p>condition of the students, class absences, and all the problems that were in class, the subject that I enjoyed when I was in grade 10 was biology, because I really like anything related to living things, and the subject I dislike the most is math, actually math is easy and fun for people who can do it, but I couldn't and in the end got bored and didn't have the enthusiasm to learn in math lessons, after a few months an exam was held, at that time the exam was held in class 10 ips 4 which consisted of classes 10 MIPA 3 with class 12, so seats are randomized, class 1 0 with class 12, at the time before the exam I studied very hard, before entering the room all the students were outside the classroom waiting for the class officer to bring the question papers and answer sheets to each class, during math lessons I got a supervisor who was quite alert in supervising the exam, I was very confused about working on my math exam questions, because I only understood a little material during the previous study process, and finally I got an unsatisfactory grade in math. During semester 2 I took part in Pencak Silat extracurricular activities at Tegal 2 high school, the extracurriculars were held on Tuesdays after school and Thursdays after school, at that time I went to practice I didn't know anything, I was late for school extracurricular activities that have been going on for about 3 months, I followed and participated in these extracurricular activities, slowly I was able to memorize and understand the techniques in the pencak silat extracurricular, and it arrived at the inauguration of the members of the pencak silat college, I took the initiative to register myself with several my friends named, irfan, David, naufal, hekal, april, diyah, alifa, and many others. At the time of the inauguration of members at Tegal 5 Middle School, which took place in the afternoon until tomorrow, the first activity was re-registration for all those who took part in the inauguration and level increase exams at the Pencak Silat College, in the evening we were invited to watch it together the historical screening event from the Pencak silat college, I watched from 10.30-12.15 after that we took a short break and continued stretching before running together, stretching was done to reduce the potential for injury to the body, stretching was done and joint running activities were carried out, running together starting from junior high school 5 then turning right, continuing until past the river kemiri, then turning left towards the Sumur Panggang field, we were told to practice crawling, pushups together, all the tiring activities, all the participants continued to line up and continue running towards the south until at the T-junction Cik Ditiro walk, then S arrived at the South Tegal Field, in the South Tegal field all the participants took a break and carried out the orders given by the implementation committee, then all the inauguration participants headed back to Tegal 5 junior high school at 04.00, at 07.00 a match was held for all participants, I sparring with a person called yoga, during the spar I suffered a serious injury, namely my</p>

  <p>wrist was swollen due to the wrong way of parrying an attack, and the inauguration was over, when I got home I still felt pain in my left hand for the next week, when it finally I was taken for treatment to a fracture specialist, it turned out that my finger bones were fractured, and my hands were in plaster, so they didn't move much, for 2/3 months my hands were in plaster I was very stressed, after a few months the hands finally healed but not one hundred percent, after that I took part in the selection for the pencak silat contest for the Tegal city branch, but I didn't I entered because my opponent was better than me, and I took part in the race again and I won 3rd place, after a while I was drawn into the Tegal city branch of pencak silat, there I practiced every day, from morning and evening finally the match Pekalongan residency level was held, thank God I won 3rd place, and I continued to practice and take part in several competition events in various regions, at that time the Covid-19 pandemic was taking place, competitions were getting rarer, and practice was also getting rarer, at the Tegal city branch of the pencak silat I lasted from 2019-2021 for a long </p>
  <img src="./img/gambarkares.jpg">
  <p>time, after graduating I stopped taking training at the Tegal city branch of pencak silat and focused on developing pencak silat in college, I trained silat at my old school, namely Tegal 2 state high school, at first many people take part in the practice, but less and less are taking part in the practice and only 1 is left 1 person, until now I still teach pencak silat at my old school.</p>

  <h2>Daily Activity</h2>
  <p>my daily activities are not too much, from waking up to sleeping again it's pretty much the same every day, for example on Monday I wake up between 06.00 and 08.00, then I am taking a shower in the morning but sometimes I rarely take a shower in the morning because I usually take a shower before going to bed so in my sleep I am clean, after a shower I usually look for breakfast, the food I am always eating is ponggol food, lengko rice, yellow rice, and kupat hunchback. When I eat, I am always accompanied by watching my favorite video, which is watching the One Piece anime. I am have been eating while watching the One Piece anime for about a year, starting from episode 1 until now, it has been episode 771 when I made this autobiography. Then after eating I am preparing whatever I will take to campus, usually the things I am always carrying are laptops, wallets, cellphones, books, pens, and headsets. The trip to campus was quite fast, because the distance between my house and campus was only 2.0 km. First, I left my housing complex to Jalan Gajah Mada, then followed the road past Pacific Mall, past Transmart, past Rita Mall, past the Maritime Building, and entering the education road to campus, after arriving on campus I am immediately parking my motorbike, I immediately headed into the class that had been determined to study and teach. During the learning process in class I always try to pay attention to any material provided by the teacher, every sentence every word I try to listen to and understand, after the first course is finished I am always invite or be invited to the canteen by my friend, my friend named farkhan , surur, Sigit, rohman, adit, ali, rojak are friends who are most often with me during campus activities, when in the canteen I was often ordering coffee to keep me focused during teaching and learning activities, but when my stomach starts to hurt after drinking I stop drinking coffee and replace it with tea, I'm thankful my stomach doesn't hurt anymore, when I drink tea I eat fried tempeh, tofu, or other snacks. After eating, we are usually go back to class or go straight to the mosque which is in on our campus, usually on Thursdays everyone waits for prayer time by telling anything, when prayer time comes, we are praying, and after praying we all return to class and prepare for the second course, after the second course I am deciding to go home, when I get home I am usually washing my face first then lay down to rest while playing with my mobile phone, After that I am opening my laptop and usually I am watching YouTube, movies, or do any assignments, watching activities continue until 7 pm, after that I play games while taking a break after doing any assignments, usually the assignments that are always there are web programming courses and PBO, the two courses always have assignments even if it's only 1 command but writing code code is something that is difficult for a beginner like me, I have to watch videos from YouTube, look for journals, find ways on Google, on GPT, on Github, and so on, after watching I immediately practice </p>

  <p>and after that there is usually an error code that's where I get confused looking for the problem, the language I haven't mastered and finding the problem is very difficult and I have to solve it, the game I am playing is usually a game on my cellphone, namely the COC game which based on war strategy, I have played this game since grade 7 in junior high school, until now g which is more or less as long 7 years, from the beginning then my account disappeared and started again with a new account and lasted until now, and my second game is the mobile legends game, a 5 vs 5 war strategy game, I played the game from 9th grade in junior high school, and until now still playing it I play mobile legends with random people I meet when I'm in the game, usually 1 classic game takes about 15 minutes, it depends on how difficult the enemy is, the more difficult the longer the game, but if our teammates are not great maybe the game is only 10 minutes because we lost against the enemy, the activity after that is helping parents, my parents trade </p>
